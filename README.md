Project Introduction

This project uses Python + Matplotlib animation to transform real tide data (tide_level) into a heart-shaped figure that “beats” with the rhythm of the ocean.
At its core, the heart is drawn using a mathematical parametric equation, while its size and transparency are dynamically controlled by tide values, creating a living, breathing visualization.

About the “Heart of the Tide” 💖🌊

This heart is more than just a mathematical curve—it symbolizes the resonance between the ocean and life itself.
Its outline is based on the classic heart parametric equation, but its beating rhythm is powered by real tidal movements.

In the natural world, the ebb and flow of tides not only shape coastlines but also govern the rhythms of marine life. Fish swim with the rising waters, corals expand and contract with the waves, and many marine animals rely on tidal cycles for reproduction and migration.

Thus, this heart does not represent a single human heartbeat—it is the heartbeat of the entire ocean:

When the tide rises, the heart grows larger and stronger, symbolizing life flourishing in the abundance of water.

When the tide retreats, the heart contracts, breathing more softly, reminding us of the fragility and rhythm of the sea.

The gentle flickers and pulsations resemble the ocean whispering to us, telling stories of tides, ecosystems, and the eternal cycle of life.

It is both a scientific visualization—showing how tidal data can shape forms—
and an artistic expression, allowing viewers to feel the rhythm of the ocean and the vitality of marine life.
